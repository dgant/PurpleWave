## How to build PurpleWave
[See build instructions in install.md](install/install.md)

Steps: 
* Clone or download this repository (I keep it in c:\p\pw but it should work from anywhere)
* Put bwmirror_v2_5.jar in /lib
* Make a copy of bwmirror_v2_5.jar called bwmirror_v2_5.zip
* From bwmirror_v2_5.zip, extract bwapi_bridge2_5.dll, libgmp-10.dll, and libmpfr-4.dll to /lib
* Open IntelliJ IDEA
* In IntelliJ IDEA: File -> Settings -> Plugins -> Check off Scala
* In IntelliJ IDEA: File -> Open -> Select the PurpleWave directory
* In IntelliJ IDEA: File -> Project Structure -> Select the Java Development Kit directory (like c:\Program Files\Java\jdk\1.8.0_121)
* In IntelliJ IDEA: File -> Project Structure -> Modules -> The green "+" -> Scala -> Create... -> Download... -> 2.12.6... -> OK
* In IntelliJ IDEA: File -> Project Structure -> Modules -> Dependencies -> Under "Export" check both bwmirror_v2_5 and scala-sdk-2.12.6
* In IntelliJ IDEA: Build -> Build Artifacts... -> Build

This will produce PurpleWave.jar. See below for "How to run PurpleWave"

You should find PurpleWave.exe in a directory with several DLLs which it needs to run:
* BWAPI.dll
* bwapi_bridge2_5.dll
* libgmp-10.dll
* libmpfr-4.dll

## How to run PurpleWave
* From IntelliJ IDEA: Run -> Run 'PurpleWave' or Debug 'PurpleWave'
* As a JAR: java.exe -jar ./out/artifacts/PurpleWave.jar <-- Make sure you use a 32-bit version of java.exe!
